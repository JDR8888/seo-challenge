# Description
Given starter-code, the challenge is to change all (or as many as possible) non-semantic html elements to appropriate semantic elements (e.g. changing a div to a header, nav, main, section, etc., element). Second, one must make the site more accessible by adding an appropriate title, as well as alt text for images and icons. In addition to editing the html doc, the CSS file has been cleaned up, removing redundant or unnecessary selectors, attributes, etc., but without affecting the look/function of the mock website. view the deployed project @ https://jdr8888.github.io/seo-challenge/ and inspect the html and css.
# Installation
N/A
# Usage
One can view the repo (https://github.com/JDR8888/seo-challenge) to compare the initial files full of redundancy, non-semantic elements, poor accessibility, etc., and compare those files to the current state of the html and css files, to get inspiration or insight into better practices when it comes to coding for web development.
